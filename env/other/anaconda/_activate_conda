# -- conda virtual python environment --
#
# To define the python environment for an anaconda python environment,
# load this from * the project root folder * (i.e. umber/) with
#
#     $ source env/_activate_conda
#

# First define the project environment variables.
source env/_set_shell_variables

# Then load anaconda's python environment and its software paths.
#   * This assumes that anaconda's "activate" is in already in your PATH
#     and that the conda python umber environment has been created.
#   * See ./environment.yml for python & package installation specs.
source activate umber
