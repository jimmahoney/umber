About Umber
===========

What is this thing?
-------------------

It's a web application that manages course materials and student work.

<a href="mailto:jimmahoney@bennington.edu">Jim Mahoney</a> wrote it,
mostly during his Fall 2017 sabbatical from Marlboro College. His
[Bennington computing classes](https://cs.bennington.college) are
hosted in this system, as well as his [previous courses at Marlboro
College](https://cs.marlboro.college).


What does the name mean?
------------------------

Nothing. It's short and fairly unique, that's all. Better than
[Wikiacademia](https://cs.marlboro.college/courses/help/) anyway.

Can I see the source?
---------------------

Sure, it's on [github](https://github.com/jimmahoney/umber) .
