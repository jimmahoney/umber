blurb
-----

This is a first class in computer programming, and as such a
foundation class for further work in computer science. Much as a
competency with English grammar is required for writing, an
understanding of programming is required to for nearly all
intermediate and advanced work in computer science.

A similar course is offered every Fall, though the language chosen
varies from year to year. Python is a modern, elegant, high level
scripting language, used for scientific programming, web servers, and
all sorts of other things. It's been one of the most popular
programming languages at Marlboro.

Topics will include program design, boolean logic, debugging,
input/output, object oriented programming, as well as a variety of
basic computer skills.  Expect weekly practice problems (for a single
term grade based on how many are turned in), a small midterm project,
and a final project.

We'll be following the text pretty closely, so check it out for more
details.
