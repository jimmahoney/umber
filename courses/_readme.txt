umber
-----

This is the root folder of an umber course management system.

Web access to this folder or "home" in this folder is redirected
in the umber source code to ./site/docs/home . (The site/docs
folder should be set by its .access.yaml access rights file
to be readable by anyone, unlike this folder.)

See the paths in sys/navigation.md for site managment by the
admin user.
