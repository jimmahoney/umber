About Umber
===========

What is this thing?
-------------------

It's a web application that manages course materials and student work.

Jim Mahoney (computer science at Marlboro College)
wrote it, mostly during his Fall 2017 sabbatical. 
And a few other Marlboro faculty use it too. 
You can find some of their courses hosted at
<a href="https://cs.marlboro.college">https://cs.marlboro.college</a> .

An earlier version was called [Wikiacademia](https://cs.marlboro.college/courses/help/).

What does the name mean?
------------------------

Nothing. It's short and fairly unique, that's all. Better than Wikiacademia anyway.

Can I see the source?
---------------------

Sure, it's on [github](https://github.com/jimmahoney/umber) .

Who can use it?
