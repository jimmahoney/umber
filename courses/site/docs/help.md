<b>What is this thing?</b>

That's described on the [about](about) page.

<b>Who can use this?</b>

The software itself is open source - check out the [about](about) page.

Much of the Marlboro course content is visible to anyone, however, 
page editing is restricted to faculty and students. 

<b>How do I log in?</b>

If you're enrolled in a course, then your faculty member or site admin
(that's Jim at Marlboro) should have set you up with an account. Click the "log in" 
button at the top right of the window. 

<b>What can I do once I'm logged in?</b>

That depends on which course and page you're visiting, and whether you're 
a student or faculty in that course.

  * Read open pages like this one, including much of the course content.

<b>How do I edit a page?</b>

If you have the rights to modify a page, you'll see an "edit" tab 
near the top of the window.

What you can type after you click "edit" is described on the 
[markdown syntax](markdown) help page.

Once you're editing a file, you can drag files from your desktop onto 
its "drop files here to upload" region to upload attachments, which
are placed into a nearby folder. If the page is named "foo.md", 
then its attachments will be pladed in "foo.attachments".

<b>What's with these folders?</b>

The files for each course are in a hierarchy of folders, 
just as they are on your computer. Visiting the url of
a folder shows you the files in that folder, unless
an index.html or index.md file hides the listing.

If you have the rights to edit that folder, then clicking
the "edit" tab allows you to upload files to the folder and
create subfolders. Faculty can also set access rights.

If in doubt, ask [Jim](mailto:mahoney@marlboro.edu). :)

The [old help pages](https://cs.marlboro.college/courses/help/) might also be of some use.
