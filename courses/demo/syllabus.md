Yes, you've found the <b>Demo Course</b> syllabus.

 If this where a real course, you'd likely find textbook information,
 details on when and where the course would run, and all that.
 For the demo course, this page is mostly a placeholder.

The home page (look to the left for the navigation links) lists
several usernames and passwords; log in with one of those roles,
click the links on the left, read the [help](~~/help) blurbs, and try
